    "petaiguide-text": "<strong>Taming Guide: General Concept</strong>\n\nThis guide is an attempt to explain the taming mechanics introduced by the \"Pet AI\" mod.\n\nPet AI itself does not introduce any tameable creatures. It is just a framework for other mods to make creating pets more easy. Most pets will be able to receive commands by the player. To give your pet a command, you need to crouch right click on it. A small GUI will open containing the various commands your pet will accept. But be aware, as your pet will only execute commands if you are a good pet owner. That generally means feeding your pet regularly, but can also be expanded to engaging in playful activities with it.\n\nPet AI currently supports four different aggression levels for pets:\n<strong>Passive:</strong> Your pet won't harm anybody.\n<strong>Neutral:</strong> Your pet will only attack if provoked.\n<strong>Protective:</strong> Your pet will fight along your side, it will defend you from evil creatures and hunt down your victims.\n<strong>Aggressive:</strong> Your pet will attack a small selection of creatures on its own.\n\nIf you feel the urge to try and remote control your pet, check out the pet whistle. It also makes your pet more useful when hunting.\nCheck out the pet cushions too. They are purely decorative but sometimes your pets will sleep in them.",

    "feverstonehorses:horsetamingguide-text": "<strong>A Guide to Horse Taming:\n-----by Verlia</strong>\n\n<strong>For those wanting the vanilla taming and saddlebreaking experience, it will still work as well!</strong>\n\nTaming a horse is fairly simple!\nFirst, you will need to find a food that horses will enjoy! Dry grass is a good start, but other foods will be preferred.\nTry out a variety!\n\nRight clicking a wild horse with a compatible food item will start the taming process.\nEach feeding will increase taming percentage until the process is complete. Now you can name your new horse!\nFeeding your horse after taming is complete will increase its obedience, so when you give it a command it will be more inclined to listen.\n\n<strong>--Now you'll need to equip it!--</strong>\nEach breed has their own saddle, bridle, and saddlebags. You'll need at least bronze to make nails and strips for certain craftables!\n\nNow that your horse is equipped, mount up on your new horse by right clicking on the Selection Box above the saddle. An empty hand is needed.\nDismount your horse by pressing the sneak key.\n\nHorses can eat from troughs and breed just like other domesticated animals.\nSome of their favorite foods are carrots, apples, and grains, and each will affect them differently!\n\n\n<strong>Keep an eye out for more attachments in the future!</strong>"
